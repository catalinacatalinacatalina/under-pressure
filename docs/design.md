# Under Pressure - Circuit Design

## Overview

This is a minimal-parts-count analog distortion circuit based on Brian Wampler's design. The circuit was first built and validated on breadboard, then converted into a PCB design.

## Current Project Status

- Breadboard prototype is working and validated.
- PCB design is complete.
- PCB manufacturing order is pending.

**Note**: This simplified version **excludes the passive tone control stage** for minimal component count. It includes only power supply, two gain stages with clipping, and an output buffer.

## Circuit Architecture

![](../hardware/schematics/stages.png)

The circuit consists of three main stages: the **Power Supply** stage provides DC power to all circuit components, the **Distortion Core** implements two gain stages with clipping diodes to shape the distortion character, and the **Output Buffer** provides final amplification with impedance buffering for clean output.

The intersection in all three stages is **vref** in the original schematic.

### PCB Phase
It is hardly recommended in terms of space to use PCB components, but in order to maintain simplicity I am using the same components from the breadboard phase. Keep this in mind if you use the KiCad files or if you manufacture this PCB.


## Modifications from Wampler's Original
1. This version excludes stage IV for simplicity.
2. Small changes in capacitors due to the lack of capacitors when buyed
